Welcome to Scopes
-----------------

Scopes is a retargetable programming language & infrastructure.

See [Tags](https://hg.sr.ht/~duangle/scopes/tags) for releases.

Features
--------

* A performant systems programming language that feels like a scripting language.
* Aims to combine the **expressivity** of Scheme with the **convenience** of Python, Lua or Javascript and the **performance** of C.
* Compile-time **resource management** using view propagation, an annotation-free variation of **borrow checking**.
* A single codebase targets native 64-bit **Linux**, **Windows** and **macOS** as well as **SPIR-V** and **GLSL** shaders. Your math functions run on CPU and GPU without modification.
* **Fully interoperable** with C libraries. Import and use C include files directly.
* Support for **live code execution** as well as **offline compilation** of object files.
* **Statically typed** but **fully inferred** type system via forward propagation. Supports **closures** as zero-cost abstraction.
* **Open Source** [MIT licensed](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
* Built with [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and [clang](http://llvm.org/) for **multi-stage programming** features and **overhead-free** interoperability with C libraries.

See [Documentation](http://scopes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.
